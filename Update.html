<p><center><font size="+4"><a style="color:white;"> I probably wont be on often, if at all, for a while. I want to let everyone know so i dont just disappear without anyone knowing why. My mom is being put on hospice and im not sure how long she has so im going to be trying to spend any time i can with her. If you message me I will answer back it may just take some time. Thank you to everyone who has been there for me.</a></font></center></p>
